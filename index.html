 <h1>my favorite artist of all time.</h1>
      <h4>created by marian hernandez</h4>
      <p>As an avid music enjoyer, I listen to a lot of different genres. I listen to almost anything (except for country music, I tried to give it a chance), whether it be nostalgic 2000s hits, k-pop, j-pop, hispanic music, or r&b to name a few. This also means that I've had my few shares of hyperfixations in different artists and their music. However, as of recent, I've been absolutely obsessing over someone I've been actually listening to for years. I just haven't really taken the time to really <i>obsess</i> over her. Her recent songs that have been released really pulled me back into the rabbit hole I dug for myself back in 2017.</p>
