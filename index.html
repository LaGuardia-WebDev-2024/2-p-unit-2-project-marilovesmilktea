 <h1>my favorite artist of all time.</h1>
      <h4 class="baby-titles">created by marian hernandez</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">As an avid music enjoyer, I listen to a lot of different genres. I listen to almost anything (except for country music, I tried to give it a chance), whether it be nostalgic 2000s hits, k-pop, j-pop, hispanic music, or r&b to name a few. This also means that I've had my few shares of hyperfixations in different artists and their music. However, as of recent, I've been absolutely obsessing over someone I've been actually listening to for years. I just haven't really taken the time to really <i>obsess</i> over her. Her recent songs that have been released really pulled me back into the rabbit hole I dug for myself back in 2017.</p>
     
      <p class="paragraph">Growing up, I've always watched Disney Channel and Nickelodeon and emersed myself in all of the hilarious (at the time) shows. I could watch them for hours on end. One was "Girl Meets World", to which I didn't show much interest to. The only thing I really took interest to was Sabrina Carpenter because I thought she was <i>GORGEOUS</i>, and when I found out that she made <b>music</b>? I was sat.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">So, without further ado. Here are my top three favorite Sabrina Carpenter songs ranking from third to first!</p>
      <hr size="10" color="#c7e7ef">
      <center><h2>
        because i liked a boy
      </h2></center>
      <center><h4>
       <i>too</i>  iconic not to mention.
      </h4></center>
      <p class="paragraph"><i>because i liked a boy</i> is a song that resonates with me so much. As corny as it sounds, this song helped me get through several -- and I mean <b>several</b> heartbreaks. The lyrics hit a bit too close to home, giving me some sort of exposure therapy, and that combined with Ms. Carpenter's angelic voice actually helped so much. I can fully remember myself listening to this song in the car, in the shower, right before I go to bed, while I do my makeup. People might call me basic for putting this song at third place, but it's truly a song that has a special place in my heart.</p>

        This was just the beginning of Sabrina's now iconic look and sound, as you can see her very well known baby bangs are finally starting to form and really because a staple look for her! Right next to the gorgeous picture of her is my favorite line from the song, she has such a way with lyrics that I'll be getting into with the next two songs that I'll be listing! But for now, all I'm going to say is that if you ever need a good cry, or just some good ol' heartbreak anthems, <i>this</i> is the song for you.

        don't smile
      </h2></center>
      <center><h4>
       fair warning, the next two songs are from the short n' sweet album, sorry not sorry.
      </h4></center>
      <p class="paragraph">
        This song from Sabrina's album is <b>not talked about enough</b>. <i>Don't Smile</i> has such an ethereal vibe to it, and the adlibs add so much to it. As a vocal major myself, I can't help but listen to the additional melodeies and harmonies that are solely Sabrina's voice. This song in specific has a playful but sad twist on the casual saying, "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened," to which Sabrina says the opposite. Sabrina has a way of playing with words and making such playful and unique lyrics that make almost anyone know at least one of them. Even my own father knows a good handful of songs from Short n' Sweet.
